            On rare occasions, we exhibit the videos we have created at video
            events. I create works in various styles that are not bound by
            genres such as cool, cute, simple, and spooky. The video is
            exhibited under a different name. Below is a sample work.
          </p>

      <div className="footer_space"></div>
